        <h2>How Physical Activity Reduces Stress</h2>
        <p>
            Stress is a natural part of life, but too much of it can negatively affect your mental and physical health.
            One of the most effective and natural ways to manage stress is through regular physical activity.
            Exercise does not only benefit the body — it also supports a healthy mind.
        </p>

        <h3>Why Exercise Helps Reduce Stress:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Releases Endorphins:</strong> Physical activity stimulates the release of endorphins —
                the "feel-good" hormones that improve your mood and create a sense of well-being.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Reduces Stress Hormones:</strong> Exercise lowers levels of cortisol and adrenaline,
                the hormones responsible for stress, helping you feel calmer.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Improves Sleep:</strong> Regular activity promotes deeper and better-quality sleep,
                which is crucial for mental recovery and stress management.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Boosts Confidence:</strong> Achieving fitness goals, even small ones,
                builds self-esteem and reduces anxiety.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Provides Mental Break:</strong> Focusing on movement and breathing during workouts
                helps clear your mind and gives you a break from daily worries.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Best Activities for Stress Relief:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Walking or Jogging:</strong> Simple and effective for boosting mood and clearing your thoughts.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Yoga and Stretching:</strong> Calm the mind and relax the body through mindful movement and
                breathing.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Dancing:</strong> Fun and energizing way to release tension and improve mood.</li>
            <li><strong>Strength Training:</strong> Focused exercise that helps channel stress into positive energy.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Team Sports:</strong> Social interaction combined with activity reduces loneliness and stress.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Remember: You don’t need hours at the gym to feel the benefits.
            Even <strong>20–30 minutes a day</strong> of moderate exercise can help you manage stress,
            improve focus, and feel more balanced.
            Stay active — your body and mind will thank you!
